**Folders:**
1. **bam** - reads mapping
  codes for mapping sequence capture reads to reference genome
2. **vcf** - variants calling
  * codes for calling SNPs from mapped population
  * filter the vcf files with criteria screened from reads status distribution
  * fst analysis mapping out the SDR region
3. **phase** - phasing X and Y haplotype
  * bash scripts in using BEAGLE 5.0 to phase haplotypes
  * python scripts to extract haplotypes
  * phylogeny reconstruction of X and Y haplotypes
